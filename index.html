        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            As a Cybersecurity Engineer with a focus on Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Assessments, and Penetration Testing (VAPT), I specialize in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, simulating real-world cyberattacks, and implementing robust defenses to protect critical systems from malicious threats. My journey into cybersecurity began at an early age, driven by a fascination with digital systems and a deep desire to protect them from cybercriminals. This passion has shaped both my career and personal growth, inspiring me to aim for global recognition as one of the leading ethical hackers.
            
            I hold a Master of Technology in Computer Science, specializing in Cybersecurity, and have worked full-time in the cybersecurity field throughout my studies. This combination of academic learning and practical experience has allowed me to refine my skills in penetration testing, network security, and threat mitigation, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on expertise in real-world scenarios.
            
            Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in managing and configuring critical security systems, including firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and leading red team operations. My work in VAPT, vulnerability management, and ethical hacking has sharpened my ability to assess and defend against potential cyber threats, ensuring the security of vital systems within my organization.
            
            Driven by a passion for continuous learning and innovation, I view ethical hacking as a mission to make the digital world safer. My long-term goal is to become a leader in the cybersecurity field, specializing in VAPT, and to contribute to the global effort to protect digital assets from emerging threats. I am dedicated to advancing in this field, always striving to be at the forefront of cybersecurity excellence..</p>
